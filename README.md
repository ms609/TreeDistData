'[TreeDistData](https://ms609.github.io/TreeDistData/)' is an R package 
containing the functions and scripts used to
compare the performance of tree distance metrics in Smith (in review).

"[Articles](https://ms609.github.io/TreeDistData/articles/)" lists vignettes
detailing the output of analyses corresponding
to the stated sections of Smith (in review).  Each of these pages includes a
link to the R source code, which can be used to reproduce the analytical
results.

"[Reference](https://ms609.github.io/TreeDistData/reference/)" lists
convenience functions, which facilitate calls to 'TreeDist', and data objects 
that store the results of lengthy analyses.  The code used to generate
these data objects is available in the
[`data-raw`](https://github.com/ms609/TreeDistData/tree/master/data-raw)
directory.
