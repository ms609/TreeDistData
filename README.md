# TreeDistData
This package provides data files used to build the vignettes in the `TreeDist` package.
Because the data files are large, they are not installed with `TreeDist`.

# Installation

(#TODO submit to CRAN!)
Install and load the library from CRAN as follows:
```
install.packages('TreeDistData')
library('TreeDistData')
```

If you're feeling brave, you can install the development version thus:
```r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('ms609/TreeDistData')
```
