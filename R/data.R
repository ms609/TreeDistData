#' Mean distances between random pairs of trees
#'
#' A three-dimensional array listing the normalized distances between 100 random
#' pairs of trees drawn from the uniform distribution using
#' `ape::rtree(nTip, br=NULL)`.
#'
#' Rows are named with an abbreviation of the tree comparison metric.
#' Columns list the mean and standard deviation of calculated tree distances.
#' The third dimension lists the number of tips in the trees compared.

#' Distances between random pairs of 25-tip trees
#'
#' A two-dimensional matrix listing the normalized distances between random

#' `ape::rtree(nTip, br=NULL)`.
#'
#' Rows are named with an abbreviation of the tree comparison metric.
#' * #TODO list these and state how normalized.
