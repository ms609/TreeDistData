\title{Distances between random pairs of 25-tip trees}
\format{An object of class \code{matrix} with 9 rows and 1000 columns.}
\usage{
distanceDistribution25
}
\description{
A two-dimensional matrix listing the normalized distances between random
pairs of 25-tip trees drawn from the uniform distribution using
\code{ape::rtree(nTip, br=NULL)}.
}
\details{
Rows are named with an abbreviation of the tree comparison metric.
\itemize{
\item #TODO list these and state how normalized.
}

Each column lists the calculated distances between each pair of trees.

The pairs of trees are saved as data object \code{\link{randomTreePairs25}}.
