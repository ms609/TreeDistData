\usage{
sevenTipDistances
}
\description{
Distances between each possible pairing of the 945 unrooted seven-leaf trees
(equivalent to rooted 6-leaf trees).  Following Kendall and Colijn (2016).
}
\details{
Each list entry is named with the abbreviation of the corresponding tree
distance method (see 'Methods tested' below).

Each item in the list contains a 945Ã—945 matrix reporting the distance
between each pair of seven-leaf trees.  The first 630 trees are pectinate
(tree shape 0), the final 315 are balanced (tree shape 1).

\section{Methods tested}{
\itemize{
\item \code{pid}: Phylogenetic Information Distance (Smith 2020), normalized
against the phylogenetic information content of the splits in the trees
being compared.
\item \code{msid}: Matching Split Information Distance (Smith 2020), normalized
against the phylogenetic information content of the splits in the trees
being compared.
\item \code{cid}: Clustering Information Distance (Smith 2020), normalized
against the entropy of the splits in the trees being compared.
\item \code{qd}: Quartet divergence (Smith 2019), normalized against its maximum
possible value for \emph{n}-leaf trees.
\item \code{nye}: Nye \emph{et al.} tree distance (Nye \emph{et al.} 2006), normalized against
the total number of splits in the trees being compared.
\item \code{jnc2}, \code{jnc4}: Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds distances with \emph{k} = 2, 4,
conflicting pairings prohibited ('no-conflict'), normalized against
the total number of splits in the trees being compared.
\item \code{jco2}, \code{jco4}: Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds distances with \emph{k} = 2, 4,
conflicting pairings permitted ('conflict-ok'), normalized against
the total number of splits in the trees being compared.
\item \code{ms}: Matching Split Distance (Bogdanowicz & Giaro 2012), unnormalized.
\item \code{mast}: Size of Maximum Agreement Subtree (Valiente 2009), unnormalized.
\item \code{masti}: Information content of Maximum Agreement Subtree, unnormalized.
\item \code{nni_l}, \code{nni_L}, \code{nni_t}, \code{nni_U}, \code{nni_u}:
Lower, best lower, tight upper, best upper, and
upper bounds for nearest-neighbour interchange distance (Li \emph{et al.} 1996),
unnormalized.
'Best' lower bounds jump sharply when mismatched regions of a tree become
large enough that a tight upper bound cannot be exactly calculated, so
are discontinuous and cannot readily be compared between trees.
\item \code{spr}: Approximate subtree prune and regraft \acronym{SPR} distance,
unnormalized.
\item \code{tbr_l}, \code{tbr_u}: Lower and upper bound for tree bisection and reconnection
(\acronym{TBR}) distance, calculated using
\href{https://ms609.github.io/TBRDist/}{\pkg{TBRDist}}; unnormalized.
\item \code{rf}: Robinson-Foulds distance (Robinson & Foulds 1981), unnormalized.
\item \code{icrf}: Robinson-Foulds distance, splits weighted by phylogenetic
information content (Smith 2020), unnormalized.
\item \code{path}: Path distance (Steel & Penny 1993), unnormalized.
