\description{
Implementation and results of a 'Bullseye' test, after that proposed by
Kuhner and Yamato (2015).

\details{
\code{bullseyeTrees} is a list with four elements, named \verb{5 leaves}, \verb{10 leaves},
\verb{20 leaves} and \verb{50 leaves}.
Each element contains 1 000 trees with \emph{n} leaves, randomly sampled
from the uniform distribution using \code{\link[ape:rtree]{ape::rtree()}}.

\code{bull...Inferred} is a list with four elements, named as in \code{bullseyeTrees}.
Each element contains 1 000 sub-elements. Each sub-element is a list of
ten trees, which have been inferred from progressively more degraded datasets,
originally simulated from the corresponding tree in \code{bullseyeTrees}.

\code{bull...Scores} is a list with four elements, named as in \code{bullseyeTrees}.
Each element contains a three dimensional array, in which the first dimension
corresponds to the progressive degrees of degradation, labelled according to
the number of characters present or the percentage of tokens switched;
the second dimension is named with an abbreviation of the tree similarity /
distance metric used to score the trees (see 'Methods tested' below),
and the third dimension contains 1 000 entries corresponding to the
trees in \code{bullseyeTrees}.
Each cell contains the distance between the inferred tree and the generative
tree under the stated tree distance metric.

The \code{bullseyeMorph} prefix refers to the 'subsampling' experiment
described by Smith (forthcoming); the \code{bullMoDi} prefix refers to the
'miscoding' experiment.

\code{bullseyeDistances} contains two elements, tabulating the distance
between each pair of 20- and 50-leaf trees in \code{bullseyeTrees}.
For details, see \code{\link{sevenTipDistances}}.
